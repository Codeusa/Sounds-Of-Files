Sounds-Of-Files
===============

###How does it work?
It's pretty straight forward, run the jar from command line like so
```
java -jar SoundsOfFiles.jar
```
You'll be prompted to enter a path to whatever folder you wish to make sound of out of so again for exampe

```
C:\Users\Andrew\Desktop\
```
Addionally it supports command line arguments so you could simpley do 

```
java -jar SoundsOfFiles.jar C:\Users\Andrew\Desktop\
```

Listen to it create sounds based on the total bytes the file occupies, great for large projects. Can create some nifty beats at times.


I'll probably update this later to write the sounds to a file.
